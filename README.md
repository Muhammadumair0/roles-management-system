### Mailer

To ensure the deliverability of emails sent by this API, `Mailgun` is used for mailing users when they sign up, so if you want to use that feature go sign up at their website <https://www.mailgun.com>

If you want to try a different method itÂ´s ok, I used <https://nodemailer.com> for this API and they have different transport methods like: smtp.

### Stack

*   MongoDB
*   Mongoose
*   ExpressJS
*   NodeJS
*   NodeMailer
